# Start - Starter Theme for WordPress

#### Version 1.0

___

Start is a <em>light, simple</em> developer theme for <em>WordPress</em>. The idea is to create a <em>website design</em> in <em>html</em> and when it's tested and approved turn it into a <em>WordPress</em> site using this very basic theme with all the <em>WordPress</em> elements.

<h5>Starting from scratch</h5>
The theme uses the <strong>[Phone1st](https://phone1st-theme.netlify.com/)</strong> basic styles and a few basic <em>WordPress</em> styles to view the theme if you want to build a theme from scratch.

## All set for using Scss
The starter theme was built using CodeKit. Codekit is only used for parsing the scss and scripts so the theme can be easily adapted to use any scss parser.

## Includes:

+ Head cleanup
+ the usual post meta and post thumbnails
+ navigation functions
